and budgeted amount

Next split the prices and convert string to an array and convert prices to integers. Afterwards
Sort the elelments in the array in an increasing order.

Write a loop to check if the lowest is is equal to or greater than B the budget.
Finally subtract the individual prices from the budget until it is not possible
Boom you get the maximum number of houses can be purchased base on the budgeted amount.
